    <h1>VirtualFit: Virtual Trial Room</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>VirtualFit is a virtual trial room solution designed to help online shoppers confidently choose the right clothing size by creating a personalized 3D avatar based on their body measurements (e.g., height, weight, body shape). The goal is to reduce the uncertainty that comes with online shopping, especially when it comes to sizing, which often leads to returns, exchanges, and customer dissatisfaction..</p>
