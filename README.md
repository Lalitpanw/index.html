    <h1>VirtualFit: Virtual Trial Room</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
    <p>VirtualFit is a virtual trial room solution designed to help online shoppers confidently choose the right clothing size by creating a personalized 3D avatar based on their body measurements (e.g., height, weight, body shape). The goal is to reduce the uncertainty that comes with online shopping, especially when it comes to sizing, which often leads to returns, exchanges, and customer dissatisfaction.</p>

    <h3>Problem It Solves:</h3>
    <p>One of the most significant pain points in online fashion shopping is size misfit. Customers often face confusion about how an item will fit their unique body shape, resulting in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High return rates (due to incorrect sizing).</li>
        <li>Reduced customer confidence in online shopping.</li>
        <li>Increased costs for retailers due to return processing and lost sales.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using VirtualFit, users can visualize clothing fit before purchasing, which decreases the chances of choosing the wrong size and boosts customer confidence in their buying decisions.</p>
